I recently had to update my machine and realized I never really had a list of tools that I use.  I would reach for a tool and when it wasn't there go and install it.  There are likely many more robust lists of ios/mac software tools out there but these are the ones I find myself using at least once a month if not daily.

### Editors

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) gets better and better each year.  I've flirted with [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) a few times but always go back to Xcode.  Since the rewrite of the core engine in swift the editor has really grown into a proper IDE with most of the conveniences of a Jetbrains quality product.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) strikes that balance beteen text editor and IDE that I'm growing to appreciate more and more each day.  For most of my non apple platform writing I tend to lean on VSCode.

### Source Control

- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com) git client that has saved me countless hours.
- [Kaleidoscope](https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com) beautiful diff and merge tool.

### API Tools/Proxies

- [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com) HTTP proxy, invaluable for debugging networking in apps.  The addition of an [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/charles-proxy/id1134218562?mt=8) makes on device debuging that much easier. 
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) is a great for exploring, document and debuging API calls

### Utilities

- [SimPholders](https://simpholders.com) for easy inspecting of the installed app bundles on iOS simulators.  Integrates nicely when used with [FUSE](osxfuse.github.io).
- [Soulver](https://acqualia.com/soulver/) easy calculations, faster than a spreadsheet, more powerful than a calculator.
- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) monitors and records your mac's performance.  Between Xcode and the legion of electron apps invading the mac its hard to know what is slowing your machine down.

### Fonts

- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) monospaced font with programming ligatures

### Presentations

- [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) write presentations in markdown
- [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) crafting graphics, flow charts and wireframes
